# ar-js-logo-demo

Demo using [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) to display 3D rotating text in Augmented Reality.

Instructions:

1. Open [this](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) marker image in a browser tab or print it out. It works better on paper as screen glare can cause problems with marker identification.
2. Open [this demo page](https://ar-iadt.netlify.com/) on your phone (doesn't work on iOS as Safari doesn't support WebGL), and point your phone at the marker.
3. You should see something like the below.
